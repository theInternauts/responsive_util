# Responsive Design Helper
*A Developer/Designer Tool*

This is a quick and dirty jQuery plugin to place a small HTML DOM box in on a working page that will be a visual indicator of the preset @media query CSS context.

this needs A TON of work to be useful to anyone but me at the moment. 
### The current road map includes:
- accepting options upon instation
- accepting an options object for easy configuration upon instantiation
- proper documentation
- proper usage examples
- console methods for realtime threshold changes
- real-time auto-detection of CSS media queries to avoid and outmode the afore mentioned console methods

Your ideas are welcome.  [Email Cricket] (mailto:cricketw@WeAreTheInternauts.com)
