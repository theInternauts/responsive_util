A Developer/Designer Tool:

This is a quick and dirty jQuery plugin to place a small HTML DOM box in on a working page that will be a visual indicator of the preset @media query CSS context.

this needs A TON of work to be useful to anyone but me at the moment. 
The current road map includes:
-accepting options upon instation
-console methods for realtime threshold changes
-real-time auto-detection of CSS media queries to avoid to outmode the afore mentioned console methods

your ideas are welcome.
